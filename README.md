MicroORM Examples
=================

Repository to store the examples of experimenting/playing with Micro ORMs in .Net

Goal
===
Be able to use a Micro ORM for the applications planned to build in 2015. For that I need to be able to 
* create, read, update and delete rows (CRUD) in a SQL Server database
* use fulltext & semantic search to find the requested data
* use transactions to ensure data integrity
* explain patterns and their trade offs
* ensure the quality of the application using automated tests
* have an example project that uses all of these points
